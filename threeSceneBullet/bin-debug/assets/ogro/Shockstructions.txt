Shockarmor Player Mod

made by, oddly enough, shocktrooper a.k.a. John Siar

to use in sauerbraten go to your sauerbraten/packages/models/monster/ogro 
directory and move tris.md2 and skin.jpg to another folder to store.  Extract
the contents of this zip file with or without the instructions to the ogro file.

Fire up Sauer and frag!

Remember where you put the ogro files in case you want to switch them back.

Not tested in Cube...  input is appreciated.

special thanks to Mykilx for helping test the armor.
