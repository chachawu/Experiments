Created with passion utilizing adobe air.  Built with stage3d, away3d, the hype framework, twitter, and soundcloud.  In short this is a simple demo that shows how to rapidly build an app with air the source is available on github.  This demo shows how to search for tweets it displays them in a virtual fish bowl where the user can move the camera around. When the user taps on a fish they go to the given twitter search.  The fish move to sound that is coming from soundcloud and analyzed with the hype framework.  This is a really simple flash application that any developer is capable of in a minimal amount of time.
